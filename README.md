# test-apollo-heroku
Apollo test app for Heroku

This was cloned from Apollo's [Star Wars example server](https://github.com/apollographql/starwars-server) app at commit `c8760cb`. We prefer to keep our own copy to keep our tests from breaking without warning.

To run locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```
