# test-apollo-heroku
Apollo test app for Heroku

This was cloned from Apollo's [platform tutorial app](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial) app at commit `6988f69`. We prefer to keep our own copy to keep our tests from breaking without warning.

To run locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```
